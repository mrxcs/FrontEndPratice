# Front-End Pratice

Practice projects using HTML, CSS, JS, Sass, JQuery, Bootstrap 4.

## Getting Started

They are all statics so you can download it and open it in your browser.

### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites, but if you want to edit, you may need to install Sass.

## Deployment

Some projects are old and from before I've learned some good practices (like BEM and SMACSS methodologies for CSS), take this into consideration.
